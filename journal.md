### Work Done  
Before the independent study began, I had started preliminary work on a visualization of the Taylor series. Today, I incoporated the code I wrote during that work into the git repository for the main project. This included code to represent and evaluate functions and code to create a a very basic GUI and render a graph of a function.  

The code to represent and evaluate functions was solid, however the rendering mechanism was not. The graphs it created were hoplessly jagged and of inconsistent thickness. Therefore, I rewrote the render method, making use of JavaFX's prexisting methods for drawing curves. I choose to do this, rather than create the graph entirely from scratch as I originally planned, because learning how to use antialiasing and other neccesary techniques would have been a very distraction from the main focus of the independent study which is calculus.  

Additionally, I wrote code to allow the graph to be panned and zoomed using the mouse and mouse wheel. This took by far the most time (>90%) of the work session. It took so long mostly because I kept running into subtle errors that invalidated what I thought was a workable method.

Finally, I updated the journal to reflect the days progress.
